# Solid.jl

A Julia CAD and FEM code library for Julia.


There are several key steps to the finite element method:

1. Preprocessing:
	1. Element selection
	2. Meshing / discretization
2. Analysis:
	1. Element formulation, conversion to weak form, numerical integration
	2. Assembly
	3. Solution
3. Post-processing:
	1. Quantify targets (stress, strain, etc.) based on the solution (displacemnet, heat, etc.)
	2. Visualization
